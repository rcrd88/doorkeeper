Doorkeeper is a gem that makes it easy to introduce OAuth 2 provider functionality to your application.

The gem is under constant development. It is based in the [version 22 of the OAuth specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-22) and it still does not support all OAuth features.

For more information about the supported features, check out the related [page in the wiki](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/Supported-Features). For more information about OAuth 2 go to [OAuth 2 Specs (Draft)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-22).

## Requirements

### Ruby

- 1.8.7, 1.9.2 or 1.9.3

### Rails

- 3.1.x or 3.2.x

### ORM

- ActiveRecord
- Mongoid 2, 3 (only for doorkeeper v0.5+)

## Installation

Put this in your Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'doorkeeper', '~> 0.4.2'
```

Run the installation generator with:

    rails generate doorkeeper:install

This will install the doorkeeper initializer into `config/initializers/doorkeeper.rb`.

## Configuration

### Active Record

By default doorkeeper is configured to use active record, so to start you have to generate the migration tables:

    rails generate doorkeeper:migration

Don't forget to run the migration with:

    rake db:migrate

### Mongoid (only doorkeeper v0.5+)

Doorkeeper currently supports Mongoid 2 and 3. To start using it, you have to set the `orm` configuration:

``` ruby
Doorkeeper.configure do
  orm :mongoid
end
```

**Note:** Make sure you create indexes for doorkeeper models. You can do this either by running `rake db:mongoid:create_indexes`
or (if you're using Mongoid 2) by adding `autocreate_indexes: true` to your `config/mongoid.yml`

To run the test suite with Mongoid you can run `DOORKEEPER_ORM=mongoid bundle exec rake`.  Note that by default this runs the suite with Mongoid 3.0.x.  To run the test suite with Mongoid 2.4.x, you will need to do the following:

1. Change the version in the :mongoid group in the Gemfile from 3.0 to 2.4
2. Replace the spec/dummy/config/mongoid.yml file with the spec/dummy/config/mongoid_2.yml file.

With these changes the test suite will run with Mongoid 2.4.x

### Routes

The installation script will also automatically add the Doorkeeper routes into your app, like this:

``` ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  use_doorkeeper
  # your routes
end
```

This will mount following routes:

    GET       /oauth/authorize
    POST      /oauth/authorize
    DELETE    /oauth/authorize
    POST      /oauth/token
    resources /oauth/applications

For more information on how to customize routes, check out [this page on the wiki](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/Customizing-routes).

### Authenticating

You need to configure Doorkeeper in order to provide resource_owner model and authentication block `initializers/doorkeeper.rb`

``` ruby
Doorkeeper.configure do
  resource_owner_authenticator do |routes|
    current_user || redirect_to(routes.login_url) # returns nil if current_user is not logged in
  end
end
```

This block runs into the context of your Rails application, and it has access to `current_user` method, for example.

If you use [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), you may want to use warden to authenticate the block:

``` ruby
resource_owner_authenticator do |routes|
  current_user || warden.authenticate!(:scope => :user)
end
```

If you are not using devise, you may want to check other ways of authentication [here](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/Authenticating-using-Clearance-DIY).

## Protecting resources with OAuth (a.k.a your API endpoint)

To protect your API with OAuth, doorkeeper only requires you to call `doorkeeper_for` helper, specifying the actions you want to protect.

For example, if you have a products controller under api/v1, you can require the OAuth authentication with:

``` ruby
class Api::V1::ProductsController < Api::V1::ApiController
  doorkeeper_for :all                     # Require access token for all actions
  doorkeeper_for :all, :except => :index  # All actions except index
  doorkeeper_for :index, :show            # Only for index and show action

  # your actions
end
```

You don't need to setup any before filter, `doorkeeper_for` will handle that for you.

You can pass `if` or `unless` blocks that would specify when doorkeeper has to guard the access.

``` ruby
class Api::V1::ProductsController < Api::V1::ApiController
  doorkeeper_for :all, :if => lambda { request.xhr? }
end
```

### ActionController::Metal integration and other integrations

The `doorkeeper_for` filter is intended to work with ActionController::Metal too. You only need to include the required `ActionController` modules:

```ruby
class MetalController < ActionController::Metal
  include AbstractController::Callbacks
  include ActionController::Head
  include Doorkeeper::Helpers::Filter

  doorkeeper_for :all
end
```

For more information about integration and other integrations, check out [the related wiki page](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/ActionController::Metal-with-doorkeeper).

### Access Token Scopes

You can also require the access token to have specific scopes in certain actions:

First configure the scopes in `initializers/doorkeeper.rb`

```ruby
Doorkeeper.configure do
  default_scopes :public # if no scope was requested, this will be the default
  optional_scopes :admin, :write
end
```

The in your controllers:

```ruby
class Api::V1::ProductsController < Api::V1::ApiController
  doorkeeper_for :index, :show,    :scopes => [:public]
  doorkeeper_for :update, :create, :scopes => [:admin, :write]
end
```

For a more detailed explanation about scopes usage, check out the related [page in the wiki](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/wiki/Using-Scopes).

### Authenticated resource owner

If you want to return data based on the current resource owner, in other words, the access token owner, you may want to define a method in your controller that returns the resource owner instance:

``` ruby
class Api::V1::CredentialsController < Api::V1::ApiController
  doorkeeper_for :all
  respond_to     :json

  # GET /me.json
  def me
    respond_with current_resource_owner
  end

  private

  # Find the user that owns the access token
  def current_resource_owner
    User.find(doorkeeper_token.resource_owner_id) if doorkeeper_token
  end
end
```

In this example, we're returning the credentials (`me.json`) of the access token owner.

## Additional information

### Cross Origin Resource Sharing

You might want to use Doorkeeper to protect an API and want an other application running in a different context (like a mobile application) to request on your API.

For mobile application, you might have to setup Cross Origin Resource Sharing. More info [here](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/05/25/cross-domain-ajax-with-cross-origin-resource-sharing/)

In order to setup the bahavior, you can take a look at [rack-cors](https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors). It's a rack middleware that will set http headers for you in order to be able to make cross domain requests to your doorkeeper protected application (usualy your API).

[Here](https://github.com/gottfrois/doorkeeper-provider-app) is a demo application where rack-cors has been setup.
